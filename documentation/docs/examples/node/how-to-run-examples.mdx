# How To Run Examples

You can find many examples related to managing identities and channels in the [clients/client-sdk/examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/integration-services/tree/master/clients/client-sdk/examples) directory.

The next sections will describe each example in detail.

## Running Examples

In order to run examples, you will need to:

1. Get Integration Service API's endpoint by setting the `API_KEY` and `API_URL` in `.env` file.
2. Get the MongoDB endpoint for the API by setting `MONGO_URL`, `DB_NAME` and `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` file.
3. Execute `npm run example-0`.

### Install the Examples

You can install the examples by going into your local `clients/client-sdk/examples` directory and running `npm install`.

```bash
cd clients/client-sdk/examples
```

```bash
npm install
```

### Update the .env File

1. Set Integration Service API's endpoint by setting the `API_KEY` and `API_URL` in `.env` file.
2. Set the MongoDB endpoint for the API by setting `MONGO_URL`, `DB_NAME` and `SECRET_KEY` in `.env` file.

If you started the API locally using [kubernetes](../../getting_started/installation/kubernetes/local_setup), you can write
the following `.env` file:

```bash
#-----------------------
# For management purpose
#-----------------------
MONGO_URL=mongodb://root:rootpassword@0.0.0.0:27017
DB_NAME=integration-service
SECRET_KEY=7w9gfhb123jngh4gd53z465fewcs569e


#---------------------
# Client configuration
#---------------------

# You can either choose a IS_GATEWAY_URL (used in production)
# or the SSI_BRIDGE_URL AND AUDIT_TRAIL_URL (for local development)

API_KEY=4ed59704-9a26-11ec-a749-3f57454709b9

SSI_BRIDGE_URL=http://localhost:3001
AUDIT_TRAIL_URL=http://localhost:3002
```

### Run Example 0

Once you have completed the previous steps, you can run [example-0](https://github.com/iotaledger/integration-services/blob/master/clients/client-sdk/examples/0-MakeRootIdentityAdmin.ts) to create a decentralized identity with `Admin` role
that will be used in the other examples using the following command:

```bash
npm run example-0
```

The admin identity will be saved in `adminIdentity.json`.

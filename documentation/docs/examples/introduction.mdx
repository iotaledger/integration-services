# Introduction

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

The following sections  will guide you on how to use the [Integration Services SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iota-is-sdk).
The Integration Services SDK makes it easy to manage decentralized identities and secure channels (Audit Trail).

You should have a basic understanding of [Decentralized Identities](../basics/identity)
to get the most out of the following examples.

## Install

You can install the Integration Services SDK using [npm](https://npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install iota-is-sdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn add iota-is-sdk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Clients

The Integration Services SDK has two different clients you can use:

### IdentityClient

You can use `IdentityClient` to manage decentralized identities.  This includes, but is not limited to:

* [Creating an identity and verifiable credentials](create-identity-and-credentials)
* [Updating users](update-users)
* [Deleting users](delete-users)
* [Adding Trusted Authorities](trusted-authorities)


### ChannelClient

You can use the `ChannelClient` to access Audit Trail features.  These include, but are not limited to:

* [Creating a channel](create-channel)
* [Subscribing or approving access to a channel](authorize-to-channel#subscribe-to-a-channel)
* [Reading and Writing on a channel](create-channel#write-on-a-channel)


You can import and configure these clients using a `ClientConfig` object:

```js

import { ClientConfig, IdentityClient, ChannelClient } from 'iota-is-sdk';

const config: ClientConfig = {
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY,        // Deployed Integration Services API KEY
    baseUrl: process.env.API_URL,       // URL of the Integration Services API 
    apiVersion: ApiVersion.v01
};

...
const identityClient = new IdentityClient(config);
...

...
const channelClient = new ChannelClient(config);
...


```

## Authorization

In order to work with Integration Services API, you will need to be authenticated with a decentralized identity.

The Integration Services use a JWT token based authorization mechanism which behaves in the following manner:

1. The client gets a nonce from the API and returns it signed by the identity's private key.
2. The API returns a JWT token to authorize any subsequent requests.

You can get an identity using the following script (no auth required):

```js
import { IdentityJson } from 'iota-is-sdk';
...

const identity = await identityClient.create('User') as IdentityJson;
```

The generated identity is stored on the IOTA Tangle and follows [did-core specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).
It is a JSON file like the following:

```json
{
  "doc": {
    "id": "did:iota:3q4mW831dfbbSP2j5Lf4FPTKXFjEv2ykyPjuVrd1FHss",
    "authentication": [
      {
        "id": "did:iota:3q4mW831dfbbSP2j5Lf4FPTKXFjEv2ykyPjuVrd1FHss#key",
        "controller": "did:iota:3q4mW831dfbbSP2j5Lf4FPTKXFjEv2ykyPjuVrd1FHss",
        "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2018",
        "publicKeyBase58": "5LT5yjaykKeTqYuqmCELE7xUyN9z4WEN5CKxdWmrU5g5"
      }
    ],
    "created": "2021-12-20T10:43:00Z",
    "updated": "2021-12-20T10:43:00Z",
    "proof": {
      "type": "JcsEd25519Signature2020",
      "verificationMethod": "#key",
      "signatureValue": "ktusPiZd5whHTHsJJwSiSbfhmAGypdkTgLFQt4USvVg91WJLYNhEzshcBCvr9Cr42heyB249TvZHVrdGVAYds6s"
    }
  },
  "key": {
    "type": "ed25519",
    "public": "5LT5yjaykKeTqYuqmCELE7xUyN9z4WEN5CKxdWmrU5g5",
    "secret": "9Arv8HTAu3JjLvBhst6deMaULvBc3e7w2WiseEL4BESC",
    "encoding": "base58"
  }
}
```

If you have a JSON Identity, you can authorize your client with the script:

```js
const identity = // ... did-core json object ...

await identityClient.authenticate(identity.doc.id, identity.key.secret);
```
